Steve would like to eat two apples per day for the next \\\\(N\\\\) days, but with strict adherence to his third motto “Consistency is key.” Specifically, he’d like the sum of the two apple weights he eats over the next \\\\(N\\\\) days to be the same for each day.\\n\\nSteve has already purchased \\\\(2*N-1\\\\) apples, the \\\\(i\\\\)th of which weighs \\\\(A_i\\\\) ounces. He'd like to buy one more apple that's as light as possible to fulfill his goal. Steve can buy an apple of any positive integer weight in ounces from the store. Is it possible for him to reach his goal, and if so, what weight apple should he buy?\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:1563872647765708|WIDTH:600}}\\n\\n\\n*The above image depicts the solution to the first sample. Each day, Steve will eat two apples totalling \\\\(7\\\\) oz. Steve must buy a \\\\(4\\\\) oz apple to make this happen.*\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\\\(1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 70\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 3*10^5\\\\)\\nThe sum of \\\\(N\\\\) over all cases is at most \\\\(600{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\leq A_i \\\\leq  10^9\\\\)\\n\\n# Input Format\\nInput begins with an integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer \\\\(N\\\\). The next line contains \\\\(2*N-1\\\\) space-separated integers \\\\(A_1, ..., A_{2*N - 1}\\\\).\\n\\n# Output Format\\nFor the \\\\(i\\\\)th test case, print \\\"`Case #i:` \\\" followed a single integer, the smallest possible apple weight in ounces that Steve can buy so that he can eat two apples for the next \\\\(N\\\\) days and have the sum of apple weights be the same every day, or \\\\(-1\\\\) if doing so is impossible.\\n\\n# Sample Explanation\\n\\nIn the first case, if Steve buys a \\\\(4\\\\) oz apple, he can group his apples as shown above. For this input, there's no way to succeed by buying any apple below \\\\(4\\\\) oz.\\n\\nIn the second case, Steve can buy a \\\\(7\\\\) oz apple, and eat two apples totaling \\\\(14\\\\) oz each day.\\n\\nIn the third case, any apple weight will suffice, so Steve will buy the lightest one possible.\\n\\nIn the fourth case, no matter what weight apple Steve attempts to buy, it is impossible for him to achieve his goal.\\n\\nPlease note, as demonstrated in the seventh case, that it's possible for the answer to exceed \\\\(10^9\\\\).\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

    "\n",
    "The RAG agent is a more complex agent that uses the retriever to retrieve the similar problems and solutions, and then uses these as few-shot examples to a model to generate a new solution. We will be using the [codecontests](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/code_contests) dataset to find the similar problems and the solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Retriving similar problems and solutions for a given problem statement is a non-trivial task. It involves indexing a large corpus of problems and solutions and then using a search algorithm to find the most similar problems and solutions. We will use the `bm25` algorithm to index the problems and solutions. However, it's important to note that two problems with similar wording - Such as `Alice` and `Bob` are not similar problems. A keyword search algorithm like BM25 might not be able to find similar problems and solutions based on the problem statement due to this limitation. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we could use `semantic search` it, would require a lot of data and compute. Therefore, we will use the `bm25` algorithm to index the problems and solutions and then use our zero-shot agent to generate a solution for a given problem statement. Then we can look for similar problems and solutions using the generated solution by comparing the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) of the problems and solutions. This is a very simplistic approach and is not perfect by any means, but it's a good starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you can just load the retriever below, however, If you wish to use your own data, you might need to pre-process the data and create the retriever. You can checkout `starter-kits/rag/retriever.py` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, simply using BM25 is not enough to find similar problems and solutions because two problems with similar solutions might have different problem statements and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can use semantic search to mitigate this by finding the most similar problems and solutions from an initial candidate pool retrieved using BM25. This should keep our compute requirements in check. We can use the `cosine similarity` to find the most similar problems and solutions."
