More like Atari 2600 BCE!_\\n\\nThe classic board game _Go_ is a two-player game played on an \\\\(R \\\\times C\\\\) board. One player places white stones while the other places black stones. On a player\\'s turn, they may place a stone in any empty space. A curiosity of Go is that stones are placed on the intersections of grid lines rather than between the lines, so an in-progress \\\\(5 \\\\times 5\\\\) game looks like this:\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:142163805651048|WIDTH:180}}\\n\\nAn orthogonally contiguous set of stones of the same color is called a *group*. A group of stones is captured (and removed from the board) once no stones in the group has an adjacent empty space.\\n\\nYou\\'re playing as Black and it\\'s your turn.

On a player\\'s turn, they may place a stone in any empty space. A curiosity of Go is that stones are placed on the intersections of grid lines rather than between the lines, so an in-progress \\\\(5 \\\\times 5\\\\) game looks like this:\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:1491241961665655|WIDTH:180}}\\n\\nAn orthogonally contiguous set of stones of the same color is called a *group*.

Given a valid board (i.e. no groups have \\\\(0\\\\) adjacent empty spaces), **is it possible to capture any white stones on this turn** with a single black stone?\\n\\nHere are some examples of captures. If a black stone is placed at the point marked with a triangle, a single white stone will be captured:\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:632037365762295|WIDTH:300}}\\n\\nHere, Black can capture a group of \\\\(3\\\\) white stones.

Initially, all cookies are scattered on the table, and you hope to find a hefty one to eat with your trusty balance scale.\\n\\nFirst, you select a single cookie uniformly at random from the table and place it on the left side of the scale. Then, \\\\(K\\\\) times, you will select a cookie uniformly at random from the table, place it on the empty side of the scale, and throw away the lighter of the two cookies on the scale (or the cookie on the left side if they both weigh the same).\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:502174485028685|WIDTH:700}}\\n\\nDetermine the probability that after throwing away \\\\(K\\\\) cookies, the remaining cookie on the scale is a yummy chocolate chip cookie from batch \\\\(1\\\\).\\n\\nIf we write this probability as a quotient of integers \\\\(p/q\\\\) in lowest terms, then you should output this quotient modulo \\\\(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\) — in other words, output the unique integer \\\\(x\\\\) such that \\\\(0 \\\\le x \\\\lt 1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\) and \\\\(p = (x * q) \\\\text{ mod } 1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le T \\\\le 1{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(2 \\\\le N \\\\le 3{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le K \\\\lt \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le C_i \\\\le 3{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le W_i \\\\le 10^{9}\\\\)\\n\\n\\n# Input Format\\n\\nInput begins with a single integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of test cases. For each test case, there is first a line containing two-space separated integers \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\). Then, \\\\(N\\\\) lines follow, the \\\\(i\\\\)th of which contains two space-separated integers \\\\(C_i\\\\) and \\\\(W_i\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n\\nFor the \\\\(i\\\\)th test case, output a single line containing `\"Case #i: \"` followed by the unique integer \\\\(x\\\\) such that \\\\(p = (x * q) \\\\text{ mod } 1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Sample Explanation\\n\\nIn the first case, there are \\\\(5\\\\) batches with \\\\(1\\\\) cookie each. Since we only weigh \\\\(K=1\\\\) time, the only way for the last cookie to be chocolate chip is if it\\'s one of the two placed on the scale. There\\'s a \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{5}\\\\) chance of picking it for the initial cookie, and a \\\\(\\\\frac{4}{5}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\) chance of picking it for the second cookie. In either case, because it\\'s the heaviest, it will remain on the scale. Adding these independent events\\' probabilities, we get a \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{5} + \\\\frac{4}{5}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{4} = \\\\frac{2}{5}\\\\) chance that the last cookie on the scale is chocolate chip. Here, we print \\\\(800{,}000{,}006\\\\) since \\\\(2 = (800{,}000{,}006 * 5) \\\\text{ mod } 1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\).\\n\\nThe second case is the same, except we must weigh a second time. There\\'s a \\\\(\\\\frac{2}{5}\\\\) chance of picking chocolate chip the first or second times, and a \\\\(\\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\) chance of picking it the third time. The answer is \\\\(\\\\frac{2}{5} + \\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{3} = \\\\frac{3}{5}\\\\). We print \\\\(200{,}000{,}002\\\\) since \\\\(3 = (200{,}000{,}002 * 5) \\\\text{ mod } 1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\).\\n\\nIn the third case, there are \\\\(2\\\\) batches of \\\\(10\\\\) cookies each, where batch \\\\(2\\\\) cookies are heavier. Since we must weigh and throw out \\\\(10\\\\) cookies, we must have weighed a cookie from batch \\\\(2\\\\) at least once, after which a batch \\\\(1\\\\) cookie can never remain on the scale. Therefore the answer is \\\\(0\\\\).\\n\\nIn the fourth case, there is a \\\\(\\\\frac{5}{24}\\\\) chance that the final cookie on the scale is chocolate chip.\\n\\n\\nSample Input:\\n6\\n5 1\\n1 3000\\n1 2000\\n1 1000\\n1 2000\\n1 1000\\n5 2\\n1 3000\\n1 2000\\n1 1000\\n1 2000\\n1 1000\\n2 10\\n10 1\\n10 2\\n5 2\\n2 50\\n1 40\\n1 50\\n1 60\\n3 50\\n4 2993\\n3000 999999999\\n2995 1000000000\\n1552 888888888\\n1336 999999999\\n3 1\\n1 10\\n2 9\\n1 11\\n\\n\\nSample Output:\\nCase #1: 800000006\\nCase #2: 200000002\\nCase #3: 0\\nCase #4: 208333335\\nCase #5: 590307096\\nCase #6: 333333336\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Solution.

Bob then takes \\\\(1\\\\) card from either deck (each of which have only \\\\(1\\\\) card left), and Alice takes the last card. But if \\\\(K_2 = 2\\\\) then Bob can always win regardless of whether Alice starts by taking \\\\(1\\\\) card or \\\\(2\\\\) cards.\\n\\nWhen \\\\(K_1 = 3\\\\), Bob can always win when \\\\(K_2 = 1\\\\). If Alice takes the single card from the second deck, Bob takes \\\\(1\\\\) card from the first deck and adds a new deck of size \\\\(2\\\\) to the table. We now have two decks of size \\\\(2\\\\), and it\\'s Alice\\'s turn. That\\'s a losing state for Alice as we saw previously.\\n\\nIf Alice takes \\\\(1\\\\) card from the first deck and adds a new deck of size \\\\(2\\\\), we now have decks of size \\\\([2, 1, 2]\\\\). Bob will pick up the pile of size \\\\(1\\\\) and again we\\'re in the same losing state for Alice. If Alice takes \\\\(2\\\\) cards from the first deck, we\\'ll have decks of size \\\\([1, 1, 2]\\\\). Bob now takes the whole deck of size \\\\(2\\\\). Alice gets the next card and Bob gets the last card. Finally, if Alice takes all \\\\(3\\\\) cards from the first deck, we\\'ll have decks of size \\\\([1, 2]\\\\). Bob can take just \\\\(1\\\\) card from the deck of size \\\\(2\\\\) to win.\\n\\nIn the second sample case:\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\\\\underline{K_1}&\\\\underline{A[K_1]}&\\\\underline{B[K_1]}&\\\\underline{C[K_1]}&\\\\underline{K_2} \\\\\\\\ 1&1&1&0&1 \\\\\\\\ 2&1&1&0&2 \\\\end{array} \\\\)\\n\\nIn the third sample case:\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\\\\underline{K_1}&\\\\underline{A[K_1]}&\\\\underline{B[K_1]}&\\\\underline{C[K_1]}&\\\\underline{K_2} \\\\\\\\ 1&1&1&0&1 \\\\\\\\ 2&1&2&0&2 \\\\\\\\ 3&2&3&1&2 \\\\end{array} \\\\)\\n\\nIn the fourth sample case:\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\\\\underline{K_1}&\\\\underline{A[K_1]}&\\\\underline{B[K_1]}&\\\\underline{C[K_1]}&\\\\underline{K_2} \\\\\\\\ 1&1&1&0&1 \\\\\\\\ 2&1&2&0&2 \\\\\\\\ 3&3&3&2&3 \\\\\\\\ 4&1&4&0&4 \\\\\\\\ 5&5&5&4&3 \\\\\\\\ 6&1&6&0&6 \\\\\\\\ 7&6&7&4&3 \\\\\\\\ 8&1&8&0&8 \\\\end{array} \\\\)\\n\\n\\nSample Input:\\n4\\n4\\n25 30 2 45 16 4 7 26 4\\n2\\n19 48 2 38 23 2 43 31 2\\n3\\n9 17 2 23 42 2 21 43 2\\n8\\n23 5 8 14 22 2 29 28 6\\n\\n\\nSample Output:\\nCase #1: 8\\nCase #2: 3\\nCase #3: 5\\nCase #4: 30\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Solution.

For a staff meal, the manager has generously provided \\\\(N\\\\) plates of dumplings in a row, numbered from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(N\\\\). Initially, plate \\\\(i\\\\) has \\\\(A_i\\\\) dumplings. In classic fashion, the duo has decided to play a game.\\n\\nAlice and Bob will take turns eating dumplings from the plates. On a given turn, a player must pick a plate adjacent to the last picked plate by the other player, and eat any positive number of dumplings from that plate. The first player who cannot do so on their turn loses. Alice goes first, and can choose any starting plate to eat from.\\n\\nFor example, suppose there are three plates holding \\\\(4\\\\), \\\\(1\\\\) and \\\\(2\\\\) dumplings respectively. On the first turn, Alice can eat \\\\(3\\\\) dumplings from the first plate. Bob must then eat the dumpling from the middle plate. Alice can respond by eating one dumpling from the third plate. Bob must then eat from plate \\\\(2\\\\), but since it’s empty now, he loses.\\n\\nAssuming both players play optimally, how many starting moves can Alice make so that she wins? Two starting moves are considered different if Alice eats from different plates, or eats a different number of dumplings.\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le T \\\\le 220\\\\)\\n\\\\(2 \\\\le N \\\\le 800{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(0 \\\\le A_i \\\\lt 2^{25}\\\\)\\n\\nThe sum of \\\\(N\\\\) across all test cases is at most \\\\(4{,}000{,}000\\\\).\\n\\n# Input Format\\n\\nInput begins with an integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of cases.

Bob will then have to take the solitary dumpling on the middle plate, and Alice can win by taking all the dumplings from the plate she didn\\'t start with. This gives Alice 6 different winning starting moves.\\n\\nIn the second case, Alice cannot win because she takes one dumpling, Bob takes the other, and then Alice has no move to make.\\n\\nIn the third case, Alice\\'s winning moves are to take \\\\(1\\\\) or \\\\(2\\\\) dumplings from the right-hand plate.\\n\\nIn the fourth case, Bob can always force a win.\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input:\\n6\\n3\\n4 1 2\\n2\\n1 1\\n2\\n2 4\\n3\\n1 3 2\\n6\\n2 2 3 3 4 4\\n8\\n6 2 8 3 1 8 5 3\\n\\n\\nSample Output:\\nCase #1: 6\\nCase #2: 0\\nCase #3: 2\\nCase #4: 0\\nCase #5: 0\\nCase #6: 19\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Solution.

On each player\\'s turn, they will choose a block type that has not yet been chosen. Note that if \\\\(K\\\\) is odd, this phase would end with Alice having chosen one more type of block than Bob. From this point on, players have access to infinitely many blocks of each of the types they chose.\\n\\nPhase 2 consists of an indefinite number of alternating turns, with Bob going first. Each player starts with a tower of height \\\\(0\\\\). On each player\\'s turn, they may pick a block of any type \\\\(i\\\\) available to them, and extend their tower height by \\\\(H_i\\\\). They may also choose to skip their turn, leaving their tower unchanged.\\n\\nIn a break from tradition, Alice and Bob want to work *together* to see if it\\'s possible for Alice to build a tower that\\'s exactly \\\\(D\\\\) units taller than Bob\\'s. In how many different ways can phase 1 be played out such that it will be possible for Alice to get her tower to be exactly \\\\(D\\\\) units taller than Bob\\'s in phase 2? Two ways are considered different if there exists an \\\\(i\\\\) such that different block types are chosen on turn \\\\(i\\\\) between the two ways.\\n\\nAs this value may be large, output it modulo \\\\(1{,}000{,}000{,}007\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\n\\\\(1 \\\\leq T \\\\leq 24\\\\)\\n\\\\(2 \\\\leq N \\\\leq 1{,}000{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(2 \\\\leq K \\\\leq \\\\min(N, 20)\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\leq D \\\\leq 1{,}000{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\leq H_i \\\\leq 1{,}000{,}000\\\\)\\n\\nThe sum of \\\\(N\\\\) across all test cases is at most \\\\(7{,}500{,}000\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Input Format\\n\\nInput begins with an integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of test cases.

Compute the minimum distance from the start to each instruction cell using orthogonal movements, without going outside of the grid or passing through any wall cells.

There are no more instructions, so the program ends and outputs \\\\(1\\\\).\\n\\nIn the second case, there are three instruction cells.

There\\'s a single shortest path to each of the cells at distance \\\\(2\\\\), so in total there are \\\\(2\\\\) shortest paths to instructions at distance \\\\(2\\\\).

The cacti are connected by \\\\(M\\\\) bidirectional trails, with trail \\\\(i\\\\) connecting cacti \\\\(A_i\\\\) and \\\\(B_i\\\\).\\n\\nFrom any cactus, it\\'s always possible to get to any other cactus by taking some sequence of trails. There may be cycles in the park, where a cycle is any sequence of trails that lead from a certain cactus back to itself. The park also has a special property that each trail belongs to at most one simple cycle. In graph theory terms, we can say that the Cactus Park forms a [cactus graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cactus_graph).\\n\\nThe park owners want to replace some number of cacti with information kiosks to help guide the tourists. Cutting down cactus \\\\(i\\\\) and building a kiosk there costs the park \\\\(C_i\\\\) dollars. The owners want to build enough kiosks so that the shortest path from every remaining cactus to the closest kiosk does not exceed \\\\(K\\\\) trails.

The ship has \\\\(N\\\\) cabins, numbered from \\\\(1\\\\) to \\\\(N\\\\), connected by corridors in the shape of an unrooted tree \\\\(t_1\\\\). For each \\\\(i=2..N\\\\), there is a corridor that connects cabin \\\\(i\\\\) to cabin \\\\(P_{i}\\\\).\\n\\nMr. Krabs noticed this business opportunity, and wants to make his own ship, also with \\\\(N\\\\) cabins, connected as a yet-to-be-determined tree \\\\(t_2\\\\). To avoid any lawsuits from the Dutchman, he would like to make his ship as different as possible.\\n\\nIn particular, let \\\\(S(t)\\\\) be the multiset of all subtrees of tree \\\\(t\\\\), where a subtree is any non-empty subset of cabins that are connected. For two multisets of trees \\\\(S_1\\\\) and \\\\(S_2\\\\), let \\\\(\\\\text{similarity}(S_1, S_2)\\\\) be the number of trees in \\\\(S_2\\\\) that are [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism) to at least one tree in \\\\(S_1\\\\). Note that \\\\(\\\\text{similarity}(S_1, S_2)\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\text{similarity}(S_2, S_1)\\\\) are not necessarily equal.\\n\\nHelp Mr. Krabs find the minimum possible value of \\\\(\\\\text{similarity}(S(t_1), S(t_2))\\\\) over all trees \\\\(t_2\\\\) of size \\\\(N\\\\).

One possible tree that minimizes the similarity score is the same tree given in the input (i.e. choose \\\\(t_2 = t_1\\\\)). Then, \\\\(S(t_2)\\\\) consists of the \\\\(6\\\\) subtrees: \\\\(\\\\{1\\\\}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\{2\\\\}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\{3\\\\}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\{1, 2\\\\}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\{2, 3\\\\}\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\{1, 2, 3\\\\}\\\\). Each subtree is isomorphic to a subtree of \\\\(t_1\\\\), so the similarity score is \\\\(6\\\\).\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:720027639598818|WIDTH:280}}\\n\\nIn the second case, one possible \\\\(t_2\\\\) that minimizes the similarity score is depicted below. This tree has \\\\(24\\\\) different subtrees, of which \\\\(21\\\\) are isomorphic to a subtree of the given \\\\(t_1\\\\). For example, the subtree \\\\(\\\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\\\}\\\\) of this \\\\(t_2\\\\) is isomorphic to subtree \\\\(\\\\{2, 3, 4, 5\\\\}\\\\) of the given \\\\(t_1\\\\), but the subtree \\\\(\\\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\\\}\\\\) of this \\\\(t_2\\\\) is not isomorphic to any subtree of \\\\(t_1\\\\).\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:854841726123175|WIDTH:350}}\\n\\n\\nSample Input:\\n2\\n3\\n1 2\\n6\\n1 2 3 4 5\\n\\n\\nSample Output:\\nCase #1: 6\\nCase #2: 21\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Solution.

For example, for the deck \\\\([5, 1, 2, 4, 3]\\\\) ordered from top to bottom, cutting \\\\(2\\\\) cards from the top would yield \\\\([2, 4, 3, 5, 1]\\\\):\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:792109885435616|WIDTH:700}}\\n\\nInitially, the \\\\(i\\\\)th card from the top is \\\\(A_i\\\\). Is it possible to cut the deck exactly \\\\(K\\\\) times to reorder the deck such that the \\\\(i\\\\)th card from the top is \\\\(B_i\\\\) for all \\\\(i\\\\)?\\n\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le T \\\\le 205\\\\)\\n\\\\(2 \\\\le N \\\\le 500{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(0 \\\\le K \\\\le 10^{9}\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le A_i, B_i \\\\le \\\\mathbf{10^9}\\\\)\\n**\\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(B\\\\) are permutations of each other.**\\n\\nThe sum of \\\\(N\\\\) across all test cases is at most \\\\(7{,}000{,}000\\\\).\\n\\n# Input Format\\n\\nInput begins with an integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of test cases. For each test case, there is first a line containing two space-separated integers \\\\(N\\\\) and \\\\(K\\\\). Then, there is a line containing \\\\(N\\\\) space-separated integers, \\\\(A_1, ..., A_N\\\\). Then, there is a line containing \\\\(N\\\\) space-separated integers, \\\\(B_1, ..., B_N\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n\\nFor the \\\\(i\\\\)th test case, print `\"Case #i: \"` followed by `\"YES\"` if it\\'s possible to cut the deck \\\\(K\\\\) times to change the deck from \\\\(A_i\\\\) to \\\\(B_i\\\\), or `\"NO\"` otherwise.\\n\\n\\n# Sample Explanation\\n\\nIn the first case, it\\'s possible to get to the new order with \\\\(K = 1\\\\) cut (cutting 2 cards from the top).\\n\\nIn the second case, it\\'s impossible to change \\\\([3, 1, 4, 2]\\\\) to \\\\([1, 2, 3, 4]\\\\) with any number of cuts.\\n\\nIn the third case, it\\'s impossible for the deck to be in a different order after \\\\(K = 0\\\\) cuts.\\n\\n\\nSample Input:\\n4\\n5 1\\n5 1 2 2 3\\n2 2 3 5 1\\n4 10\\n3 1 4 2\\n1 2 3 4\\n4 0\\n3 1 4 2\\n2 3 1 4\\n5 3\\n10 10 9 10 9\\n10 10 10 9 9\\n\\n\\nSample Output:\\nCase #1: YES\\nCase #2: NO\\nCase #3: NO\\nCase #4: NO\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Solution.

Page \\\\(i\\\\) covers \\\\(M_i\\\\) topics \\\\(S_{i,1}\\\\) ... \\\\(S_{i,M_i}\\\\), each a string of lowercase letters. Each player starts on a unique page, and will race to reach page \\\\(1\\\\) (the target page) by repeatedly clicking to neighboring pages.\\n\\nUnfortunately, someone out there has already published the shortest path from each page to page \\\\(1\\\\) for the whole internet to see. This forms a tree structure with page \\\\(1\\\\) as the root, and edges directed upwards from each descendent page. In particular, you and your friends all know that at each page \\\\(i > 1\\\\), one should click to the neighboring page \\\\(P_i\\\\) for the fastest route to page \\\\(1\\\\).\\n\\nIn light of this, all players have agreed to a new rule that each page should be visited by exactly one person per game. This means that once a player hits a page someone has already visited, their upward path ends there and the player loses. Formally, we can express each game\\'s outcome as a partition of the tree into vertex-disjoint paths, with each path\\'s upper endpoint always having an edge to a node on another player\\'s path (except the winner, whose upper endpoint is page \\\\(1\\\\)).\\n\\nAfter playing the game for so long, you\\'re all starting to realize that \"*it\\'s not about winning, but the knowledge acquired along the way!*\" \\n\\nFor a given partition of the tree into paths, a topic is _mutually-learned_ by all players if every path has at least one page covering that topic.

      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a set of positive integers such that their sum is \\(41\\) and their product is \\(P\\). If no such set exists, we should return \\(-1\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Constraints**: The maximum number of integers we can use is \\(100\\), and the product \\(P\\) can be as large as \\(10^9\\). This means we need to be strategic about how we choose our integers to ensure both the sum and product conditions are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Basic Cases**:\n",
      "   - If \\(P = 1\\), the only way to achieve a sum of \\(41\\) is to use \\(41\\) ones: \\([1, 1, 1, ..., 1]\\) (41 times).\n",
      "   - If \\(P = 41\\), the simplest solution is to use a single integer: \\([41]\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Decomposing \\(P\\)**: For other values of \\(P\\), we can factor \\(P\\) into its prime components. The product of the integers must equal \\(P\\), so we can start by breaking \\(P\\) down into its prime factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Constructing the Array**:\n",
      "   - Start with the prime factors of \\(P\\).\n",
      "   - If the sum of these factors exceeds \\(41\\), we need to adjust them to ensure the sum is exactly \\(41\\). This can be done by combining smaller factors or adding \\(1\\)s to fill the gap.\n",
      "   - If the sum of the factors is less than \\(41\\), we can add \\(1\\)s to reach \\(41\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Edge Cases**: \n",
      "   - If \\(P\\) is such that it cannot be factored into integers that sum to \\(41\\) (for example, if \\(P\\) is a prime number greater than \\(41\\)), we should return \\(-1\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution: To implement the solution, we can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For each test case, read the integer \\(P\\).\n",
      "2. If \\(P = 1\\), output \\(41\\) ones.\n",
      "3. If \\(P = 41\\), output \\(1\\) and the number \\(41\\).\n",
      "4. For other values of \\(P\\):\n",
      "   - Factor \\(P\\) into its prime factors.\n",
      "   - Calculate the sum of these factors.\n",
      "   - If the sum is greater than \\(41\\), check if we can combine factors to reduce the sum while maintaining the product.\n",
      "   - If the sum is less than \\(41\\), add enough \\(1\\)s to make the total sum \\(41\\).\n",
      "5. If no valid configuration is found, output \\(-1\\`.\n",

      "2. **Constraints**: The maximum number of integers we can use is \\(100\\), and the product \\(P\\) can be as large as \\(10^9\\). This means we need to be strategic about how we choose our integers to ensure both the sum and product conditions are met.\n",

Begin by carefully analyzing the problem statement, paying close attention to constraints, input and output formats. Identify critical elements and analyze the provided sample inputs and outputs, while also considering edge cases that may arise. Look for underlying patterns or mathematical relationships that can guide your approach. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems if necessary, and articulate the core insights in straightforward terms. Provide a step-by-step explanation of your reasoning and proposed solution, using clear language and, if beneficial, visual aids to enhance understanding. Discuss potential optimization techniques, alternative methods, and any special cases that may be relevant. Address both time and space complexity in your explanation, and include pseudocode where appropriate to illustrate your thought process. Finally, ensure that your solution is well-organized and accessible to readers of varying programming expertise, focusing on clarity and completeness.

      "\u001b[32mReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find an array of positive integers that sums to \\(41\\) and has a product equal to \\(P\\). \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a set of positive integers such that their sum is \\(41\\) and their product is \\(P\\). If no such set exists, we should return \\(-1\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Constraints**: The maximum number of integers we can use is \\(100\\), and the product \\(P\\) can be as large as \\(10^9\\). This means we need to be strategic about how we choose our integers to ensure both the sum and product conditions are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Basic Cases**:\n",
      "   - If \\(P = 1\\), the only way to achieve a sum of \\(41\\) is to use \\(41\\) ones: \\([1, 1, 1, ..., 1]\\) (41 times).\n",
      "   - If \\(P = 41\\), the simplest solution is to use a single integer: \\([41]\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Decomposing \\(P\\)**: For other values of \\(P\\), we can factor \\(P\\) into its prime components. The product of the integers must equal \\(P\\), so we can start by breaking \\(P\\) down into its prime factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Constructing the Array**:\n",
      "   - Start with the prime factors of \\(P\\).\n",
      "   - If the sum of these factors exceeds \\(41\\), we need to adjust them to ensure the sum is exactly \\(41\\). This can be done by combining smaller factors or adding \\(1\\)s to fill the gap.\n",
      "   - If the sum of the factors is less than \\(41\\), we can add \\(1\\)s to reach \\(41\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Edge Cases**: \n",
      "   - If \\(P\\) is such that it cannot be factored into integers that sum to \\(41\\) (for example, if \\(P\\) is a prime number greater than \\(41\\)), we should return \\(-1\\).\n",

      "1. For each test case, read the integer \\(P\\).\n",
      "2. If \\(P = 1\\), output \\(41\\) ones.\n",
      "3. If \\(P = 41\\), output \\(1\\) and the number \\(41\\).\n",
      "4. For other values of \\(P\\):\n",
      "   - Factor \\(P\\) into its prime factors.\n",
      "   - Calculate the sum of these factors.\n",
      "   - If the sum is greater than \\(41\\), check if we can combine factors to reduce the sum while maintaining the product.\n",
      "   - If the sum is less than \\(41\\), add enough \\(1\\)s to make the total sum \\(41\\).\n",

      "i: You are a highly skilled algorithmic problem solver tasked with providing a comprehensive and detailed explanation for a competitive programming challenge. Begin by carefully analyzing the problem statement, paying close attention to constraints, input and output formats. Identify critical elements and analyze the provided sample inputs and outputs, while also considering edge cases that may arise. Look for underlying patterns or mathematical relationships that can guide your approach. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems if necessary, and articulate the core insights in straightforward terms. Provide a step-by-step explanation of your reasoning and proposed solution, using clear language and, if beneficial, visual aids to enhance understanding. Discuss potential optimization techniques, alternative methods, and any special cases that may be relevant. Address both time and space complexity in your explanation, and include pseudocode where appropriate to illustrate your thought process. Finally, ensure that your solution is well-organized and accessible to readers of varying programming expertise, focusing on clarity and completeness. Remember, you are not required to write actual code; your goal is to create a thorough and understandable solution explanation that an experienced developer can use to implement the code.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Using 1s**: If we can find a combination of factors that sum to less than \\(41\\), we can fill the remaining sum with \\(1s\\). For example, if we find factors that sum to \\(x\\), we can add \\(41 - x\\) ones to reach the total sum of \\(41\\).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Constraints**: The sum of the integers must equal \\(41\\), and the product must equal \\(P\\). We can use up to \\(100\\) integers, but we should aim to use as few as possible to simplify our solution.\n",

      "3. **Decomposing \\(P\\)**: For other values of \\(P\\), we need to factor \\(P\\) into integers that can sum to \\(41\\). The factors of \\(P\\) will guide us in forming the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using 1s**: If we can find a combination of factors that sum to less than \\(41\\), we can fill the remaining sum with \\(1s\\). For example, if we find factors that sum to \\(x\\), we can add \\(41 - x\\) ones to reach the total sum of \\(41\\).\n",

      "4. **Filling with 1s**: If the sum of the selected factors is less than \\(41\\), calculate how many \\(1s\\) are needed to reach \\(41\\) and include them in the array.\n",

      "   - Start with the prime factors of \\(P\\).\n",
      "   - If the sum of these factors exceeds \\(41\\), we need to adjust them to ensure the sum is exactly \\(41\\). This can be done by combining smaller factors or adding \\(1\\)s to fill the gap.\n",
      "   - If the sum of the factors is less than \\(41\\), we can add \\(1\\)s to reach \\(41\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Edge Cases**: \n",
      "   - If \\(P\\) is such that it cannot be factored into integers that sum to \\(41\\) (for example, if \\(P\\) is a prime number greater than \\(41\\)), we should return \\(-1\\).\n",

      "\n",
      "1. For each test case, read the integer \\(P\\).\n",

      "4. For other values of \\(P\\):\n",
      "   - Factor \\(P\\) into its prime factors.\n",
      "   - Calculate the sum of these factors.\n",
      "   - If the sum is greater than \\(41\\), check if we can combine factors to reduce the sum while maintaining the product.\n",
      "   - If the sum is less than \\(41\\), add enough \\(1\\)s to make the total sum \\(41\\).\n",
      "5. If no valid configuration is found, output \\(-1\\`.\n",
      "\n",

      "This approach ensures that we systematically check for valid combinations of integers that meet the required sum and product, while also considering edge cases and constraints. The time complexity primarily depends on the factorization of \\(P\\), which can be done in \\(O(\\sqrt{P})\\), and the space complexity is \\(O(N)\\) where \\(N\\) is the number of integers in the output array.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\u001b[32mReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to find an array of positive integers that sums to \\(41\\) and has a product equal to \\(P\\). \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find a set of positive integers such that their sum is \\(41\\) and their product is \\(P\\). If no such set exists, we should return \\(-1\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Constraints**: The maximum number of integers we can use is \\(100\\), and the product \\(P\\) can be as large as \\(10^9\\). This means we need to be strategic about how we choose our integers to ensure both the sum and product conditions are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Basic Cases**:\n",
      "   - If \\(P = 1\\), the only way to achieve a sum of \\(41\\) is to use \\(41\\) ones: \\([1, 1, 1, ..., 1]\\) (41 times).\n",
      "   - If \\(P = 41\\), the simplest solution is to use a single integer: \\([41]\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Decomposing \\(P\\)**: For other values of \\(P\\), we can factor \\(P\\) into its prime components. The product of the integers must equal \\(P\\), so we can start by breaking \\(P\\) down into its prime factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Constructing the Array**:\n",
      "   - Start with the prime factors of \\(P\\).\n",
      "   - If the sum of these factors exceeds \\(41\\), we need to adjust them to ensure the sum is exactly \\(41\\). This can be done by combining smaller factors or adding \\(1\\)s to fill the gap.\n",
      "   - If the sum of the factors is less than \\(41\\), we can add \\(1\\)s to reach \\(41\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Edge Cases**: \n",
      "   - If \\(P\\) is such that it cannot be factored into integers that sum to \\(41\\) (for example, if \\(P\\) is a prime number greater than \\(41\\)), we should return \\(-1\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "Solution: To implement the solution, we can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. For each test case, read the integer \\(P\\).\n",
      "2. If \\(P = 1\\), output \\(41\\) ones.\n",
      "3. If \\(P = 41\\), output \\(1\\) and the number \\(41\\).\n",
      "4. For other values of \\(P\\):\n",
      "   - Factor \\(P\\) into its prime factors.\n",
      "   - Calculate the sum of these factors.\n",
      "   - If the sum is greater than \\(41\\), check if we can combine factors to reduce the sum while maintaining the product.\n",
      "   - If the sum is less than \\(41\\), add enough \\(1\\)s to make the total sum \\(41\\).\n",
      "5. If no valid configuration is found, output \\(-1\\`.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Single Element Case**: If \\(P = 41\\), the only array we can form is \\([41]\\). This is a straightforward case.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Decomposing \\(P\\)**: For other values of \\(P\\), we need to factor \\(P\\) into integers that can sum to \\(41\\). The factors of \\(P\\) will guide us in forming the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using 1s**: If we can find a combination of factors that sum to less than \\(41\\), we can fill the remaining sum with \\(1s\\). For example, if we find factors that sum to \\(x\\), we can add \\(41 - x\\) ones to reach the total sum of \\(41\\).\n",

      "1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases \\(T\\) and the values of \\(P\\) for each test case.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Factorization**: For each \\(P\\), find all possible factors. This can be done by iterating from \\(1\\) to \\(\\sqrt{P}\\) and checking divisibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Combination Search**: Use a backtracking approach to find combinations of the factors that sum to \\(41\\). If a combination is found, check if the product of that combination equals \\(P\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Filling with 1s**: If the sum of the selected factors is less than \\(41\\), calculate how many \\(1s\\) are needed to reach \\(41\\) and include them in the array.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Output Formatting**: For each test case, format the output according to the requirements, indicating the case number and the resulting array or \\(-1\\) if no valid array exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Complexity Considerations**: The time complexity will depend on the factorization and combination search, but since \\(P\\) can be at most \\(10^9\\), the factorization step will be efficient enough due to the limited number of factors.\n",

As a ramp-up exercise, Boss Rob tasked you with modeling the watering wells in his yard, which can be represented on a Cartesian plane.\\n\\nBoss Rob has a primary well at point \\\\((A_x, A_y)\\\\) and a backup well at a different point \\\\((B_x, B_y)\\\\), each able to water trees within an \\\\(R\\\\) unit radius. Using \\\\(A_x\\\\), \\\\(A_y\\\\), \\\\(B_x\\\\), \\\\(B_y\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\) (unknown integers to you), Rob plants \\\\(N\\\\) happy little trees at real number points obtained by \\\\(N\\\\) calls to the function:\\n\\n```\\ndef gen_one_tree(A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y, R):\\n    while True:\\n        r = random.uniform(0, R)\\n        theta = random.uniform(0, 2*math.pi)\\n        x = A_x + r*math.cos(theta)\\n        y = A_y + r*math.sin(theta)\\n        if (x - B_x)**2 + (y - B_y)**2 <= R*R:\\n            return (x, y)\\n```\\nHere, `random.uniform(L, H)` returns a real number in \\\\([L, H)\\\\) uniformly at random.\\n\\nIn other words, he picks a point \\\\((x, y)\\\\) in the circular range of the primary well using the special method above. If \\\\((x, y)\\\\) happens to be in range of the backup well, he plants a tree there (else he discards it and tries again with a new \\\\((x, y)\\\\)). This repeats until Rob has planted \\\\(N\\\\) trees.\\n\\nGiven only the planted tree coordinates \\\\((X_1, Y_1), \\\\ldots, (X_N, Y_N)\\\\), you are tasked to predict the exact values of \\\\(A_x\\\\), \\\\(A_y\\\\), \\\\(B_x\\\\), \\\\(B_y\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\). As you are new, Boss Rob will accept your solution if it correctly predicts at least \\\\(80\\\\%\\\\) of the test cases.\\n\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le T \\\\le 1{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(500 \\\\le N \\\\le 1{,}000{,}000\\\\)\\n\\\\(0 \\\\le A_x, A_y, B_x, B_y \\\\le 50\\\\)\\n\\\\((A_x, A_y) \\\\ne (B_x, B_y)\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le R \\\\le 50\\\\)\\nThe sum of \\\\(N\\\\) across all test cases is at most \\\\(2{,}000{,}000\\\\).\\n\\nThe intersection area of the two circular regions is strictly positive.\\n\\nTree coordinates in the data were truly generated using the randomized algorithm as described above. The secret parameters \\\\(A_x\\\\), \\\\(A_y\\\\), \\\\(B_x\\\\), \\\\(B_y\\\\), and \\\\(R\\\\) have also been chosen uniformly at random for each case (rejecting cases where the circles are identical or do not have positive overlap).\\n\\n\\n# Input Format\\n\\nInput begins with a single integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of test cases. For each case, there is first a line containing a single integer \\\\(N\\\\), the number of planted trees. Then, \\\\(N\\\\) lines follow, the \\\\(i\\\\)th of which contains two space-separated real numbers \\\\(X_i\\\\) and \\\\(Y_i\\\\), each given to \\\\(6\\\\) decimal places.\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n\\nFor the \\\\(i\\\\)th test case, print a line containing `\"Case #i: \"`, followed by the five space-separated integers \\\\(A_x\\\\), \\\\(A_y\\\\), \\\\(B_x\\\\), \\\\(B_y\\\\), and

Begin by carefully analyzing the problem statement, paying close attention to constraints, input and output formats. Identify critical elements and analyze the provided sample inputs and outputs, while also considering edge cases that may arise. Look for underlying patterns or mathematical relationships that can guide your approach. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable subproblems if necessary, and articulate the core insights in straightforward terms. Provide a step-by-step explanation of your reasoning and proposed solution, using clear language and, if beneficial, visual aids to enhance understanding. Discuss potential optimization techniques, alternative methods, and any special cases that may be relevant. Address both time and space complexity in your explanation, and include pseudocode where appropriate to illustrate your thought process. Finally, ensure that your solution is well-organized and accessible to readers of varying programming expertise, focusing on clarity and completeness.

The tile at \\\\((i, j)\\\\) is of an integer type \\\\(G_{i,j}\\\\). A *group* refers to three or more tiles of the same type, connected directly or indirectly via the four orthogonal directions (left, right, up, and down). Initially, the given grid \\\\(G\\\\) may already contain groups.\\n\\nThe player may swap two orthogonally adjacent tiles *of different types*. If the swap results in either tile being in a group of three or more tiles, then all tiles in the *newly-formed group(s)* are cleared.\\n\\nFor the example below (sample case 2), swapping the first two tiles in row \\\\(1\\\\) would clear \\\\(9\\\\) tiles:\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:1310493279783732|WIDTH:700}}\\n\\nOn the other hand, swapping the first two tiles in the second column would clear \\\\(12\\\\) tiles;\\n\\n{{PHOTO_ID:650302073463012|WIDTH:700}}\\n\\nNote that the type-3 group is not cleared because it doesn\\'t contain a swapped tile.\\n\\nPlease find the *sum* of tiles that would be cleared over all possible theoretical swaps of ordered pairs of tiles \\\\(G_{i_1, j_1}\\\\) and \\\\(G_{i_2, j_2}\\\\) such that \\\\(|i_1 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2| = 1\\\\) and \\\\(G_{i_1, j_1} \\\\ne G_{i_2, j_2}\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Constraints\\n\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le T \\\\le 105\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le R, C \\\\le 3000\\\\)\\n\\\\(1 \\\\le G_{i,j} \\\\le 10^9\\\\)\\n\\nThe sum of \\\\(R*C\\\\) across all test cases is at most \\\\(40{,}000{,}000\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Input Format\\n\\nInput begins with an integer \\\\(T\\\\), the number of cases. For each case, there is first a line containing two space-separated integers, \\\\(R\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\). Then, \\\\(R\\\\) lines follow, the \\\\(i\\\\)th of which contains \\\\(C\\\\) space-separated integers \\\\(G_{i,1..C}\\\\).\\n\\n\\n# Output Format\\n\\nFor the \\\\(i\\\\)th case, print a line containing `\"Case #i: \"` followed by a single integer, the sum of tiles that can be cleared with a single swap.\\n\\n\\n# Sample Explanation\\n\\nIn the first sample case:\\n- \\\\(G_{1,1}\\\\), \\\\(G_{1,3}\\\\), and \\\\(G_{2,3}\\\\) can\\'t be swapped with anything that leads to any tiles being cleared.\\n- \\\\(G_{1,2}\\\\) can be swapped with the type-2 tile below to clear \\\\(3\\\\) tiles.\\n- \\\\(G_{2,1}\\\\) can be swapped with the type-2 tile right of it to clear \\\\(3\\\\) tiles.\\n- \\\\(G_{2,2}\\\\) can be swapped with either the type-1 cell above or to the left, each clearing \\\\(3\\\\) tiles.\\n\\nThe answer is therefore \\\\(3 + 3 + 2*3 = 12\\\\).\\n\\nIn the second sample case, the unordered pairs of swaps clearing non-zero numbers of tiles are:\\n- \\\\(G_{1,1} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{1,2} \\\\): clearing \\\\(9\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{1,2} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{1,3} \\\\): clearing \\\\(5 + 3 = 8\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{1,2} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{2,1} \\\\): clearing \\\\(9 + 3 = 12\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{1,3} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{2,3} \\\\): clearing \\\\(5\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{1,4} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{2,4} \\\\): clearing \\\\(4\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{2,2} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{2,3} \\\\): clearing \\\\(6\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{2,2} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{3,2} \\\\): clearing \\\\(4\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{2,4} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{2,5} \\\\): clearing \\\\(4\\\\) tiles\\n- \\\\(G_{3,1} \\\\leftrightarrow G_{3,2} \\\\): clearing \\\\(4\\\\) tiles\\n\\nDoubling the sum for ordered pairs, we get \\\\(2*(9+8+12+5+4+6+4+4+4) = 112\\\\).\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Input:\\n3\\n2 3\\n1 1 2\\n1 2 3\\n3 5\\n1 2 1 1 1\\n1 1 2 2 1\\n1 3 3 3 1\\n4 4\\n1 1 1 4\\n1 2 1 1\\n3 2 3 4\\n3 2 2 2\\n\\n\\nSample Output:\\nCase #1: 12\\nCase #2: 112\\nCase #3: 74\\n\\nPlease provide the output fields Reasoning then Solution.
